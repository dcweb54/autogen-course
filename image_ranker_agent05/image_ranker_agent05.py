    - Environment: Rocky terrain, steep incline, windy conditions
    - Action: Alex encountering first real obstacles after optimistic start
    - Emotional state: Hope turning to doubt, physical struggle triggering mental uncertainty
    - Time: Daytime, natural mountain lighting
    
    KEY NARRATIVE ELEMENTS:
    - "Rocks blocked the way" - physical obstacles
    - "The wind howled" - environmental challenges  
    - "Doubt crept in" - internal emotional shift
    - "Not an expert" - amateur status important
    - "Backpack full of hope" - emotional baggage metaphor

    IMAGE DATASET FOR CONSIDERATION:

    üéØ YOUR ROLE AS ADVENTURE DIRECTOR:
    You are selecting reference images for a crucial mountain climbing scene. Consider:
    
    1. MOUNTAIN AUTHENTICITY: Does this look like real mountain terrain? (rocks, steepness, natural environment)
    2. AMATEUR CLIMBER: Does the person look like a beginner? (appropriate age, non-professional appearance)
    3. DOUBT EXPRESSION: Is the facial expression authentic doubt during physical struggle?
    4. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT: Can you sense wind, challenging conditions, outdoor elements?
    5. NARRATIVE ALIGNMENT: Does this match the "hope turning to doubt" emotional arc?
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è STORY-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS:
    - NO summit shots (this is early climb)
    - NO professional climbing gear (amateur with basic equipment)
    - NO indoor or studio-looking images
    - NO overly dramatic or theatrical expressions
    - NO age mismatches (Alex is young adult)
    
    üèÜ SELECTION CRITERIA:
    Choose images that feel like documentary footage of a real person's first mountain challenge.
    Look for authentic struggle, not posed adventure shots.
