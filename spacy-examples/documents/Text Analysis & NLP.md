Certainly! Here's an **example workflow** that outlines how **Text Analysis & NLP** can be used to automate stock footage selection based on a script. This workflow will cover all the necessary steps from **script input** to **footage selection**.

---

### **Example Workflow: Automating Stock Footage Selection Based on Script**

---

### **1. Input Script**

The process starts with the input of a **script** (either in plain text or some other format).

#### **Input**:

* A **text file** containing the script.
* **Example Script**:

  ```plaintext
  The sun was shining brightly, and the birds were chirping in the trees. It was a peaceful day. 
  The forest was alive with vibrant colors and the sound of nature all around.
  ```

---

### **2. Preprocessing the Script**

**Preprocessing** involves cleaning and preparing the text for analysis, such as removing unnecessary words, punctuation, and lemmatizing words to their root forms.

#### **Tasks**:

* **Tokenization**: Split the script into individual words or sentences.
* **Stopword Removal**: Remove words like “is”, “the”, “in” that don’t add significant meaning.
* **Lemmatization**: Convert words to their base form (e.g., "running" → "run").
* **Punctuation Removal**: Remove punctuation like commas, periods, etc.

#### **Example Code** (using **spaCy**):

```python
import spacy

# Load the pre-trained English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample script
script = """
The sun was shining brightly, and the birds were chirping in the trees. It was a peaceful day. 
The forest was alive with vibrant colors and the sound of nature all around.
"""

# Process the text
doc = nlp(script)

# Tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization
tokens = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if not token.is_stop and not token.is_punct]
print("Processed Tokens:", tokens)
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
Processed Tokens: ['sun', 'shine', 'brightly', 'bird', 'chirp', 'tree', 'peaceful', 'day', 'forest', 'live', 'vibrant', 'color', 'sound', 'nature']
```

---

### **3. Keyword Extraction**

**Keyword extraction** identifies important concepts and terms that can be mapped to stock footage. These keywords are the main **search terms** that will guide the footage selection.

#### **Methods**:

* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Identifies significant terms in the text.
* **RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)**: Extracts the most important phrases.
* **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**: Extracts entities such as locations, dates, or specific objects.

#### **Example Code** (using **RAKE** for keyword extraction):

```python
from rake_nltk import Rake

# Initialize RAKE
rake = Rake()

# Extract keywords from the script
rake.extract_keywords_from_text(script)
keywords = rake.get_ranked_phrases_with_scores()

# Print the extracted keywords
print("Extracted Keywords:", keywords)
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
Extracted Keywords: [(1.0, 'sun shining brightly'), (0.8, 'chirping birds'), (0.7, 'peaceful day')]
```

These keywords represent important terms that can be used to search for stock footage.

---

### **4. Sentiment Analysis**

Sentiment analysis helps understand the overall mood or tone of the script (positive, negative, or neutral). This will guide the emotional tone of the footage selected (e.g., cheerful, peaceful, dramatic).

#### **Example Code** (using **VADER** for sentiment analysis):

```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Initialize sentiment analyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Analyze sentiment of the script
sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(script)
print("Sentiment Analysis:", sentiment)
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
Sentiment Analysis: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.32, 'pos': 0.68, 'compound': 0.8679}
```

Here, a **compound score** of 0.87 indicates **positive sentiment**. This suggests that the footage should match a **happy, peaceful tone**.

---

### **5. Contextual Understanding**

Next, we want to understand the **context** of the script (e.g., nature, adventure, city). We can use **topic modeling** or **word embeddings** for this task.

#### **Example Code** (using **Gensim LDA** for Topic Modeling):

```python
from gensim import corpora
from gensim.models import LdaModel

# Example tokenized corpus (list of tokenized scripts)
texts = [['sun', 'shine', 'brightly', 'bird', 'chirp', 'tree', 'peaceful', 'day'],
         ['city', 'car', 'traffic', 'noise', 'building', 'skyline']]

# Create a dictionary and corpus
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]

# Apply LDA for topic modeling
lda = LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=2, id2word=dictionary, passes=15)

# Print topics
topics = lda.print_topics(num_words=3)
for topic in topics:
    print(topic)
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
Topic 0: 0.087*"sun" + 0.087*"shine" + 0.087*"bird"
Topic 1: 0.087*"car" + 0.087*"building" + 0.087*"city"
```

From the topics, we can infer that **Topic 0** is about nature and **Topic 1** is about the city. This helps us match the script’s context to footage themes (e.g., **nature footage** vs. **city footage**).

---

### **6. Stock Footage Selection**

At this stage, the system is ready to query a **stock footage database** using the extracted **keywords** and **context**. You can use APIs from stock footage providers like **Pexels**, **Pixabay**, or **Shutterstock** to fetch relevant video clips.

#### **Example Code** (using **Pexels API** to get footage):

```python
import requests

# Pexels API URL and API Key
pexels_api_key = 'YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY'
url = 'https://api.pexels.com/v1/videos/search'

# Extracted keywords and context (e.g., 'nature', 'sunshine', 'birds')
keywords = 'nature birds sunshine'

# Make a request to the Pexels API for stock footage
response = requests.get(url, headers={'Authorization': pexels_api_key}, params={'query': keywords, 'per_page': 5})

# Parse the response and get video URLs
if response.status_code == 200:
    videos = response.json()['videos']
    for video in videos:
        print(f"Video URL: {video['url']}")
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
Video URL: https://www.pexels.com/video/sunrise-in-the-desert-12345/
Video URL: https://www.pexels.com/video/sunshine-in-forest-67890/
...
```

Based on the keywords (e.g., "nature," "birds," "sunshine"), the system will retrieve **relevant stock footage** from the API and suggest them for inclusion in the video.

---

### **7. Ranking and Selection**

Finally, you can rank and select footage based on:

* **Sentiment Match**: If the sentiment is positive, select cheerful, bright footage.
* **Keyword Relevance**: Stock footage that matches the keywords like "sun," "birds," "nature."
* **Contextual Fit**: Choose footage that matches the **topic** of the script (e.g., nature-related footage for a peaceful forest script).

---

### **8. Final Output**

The final output will be a curated list of **stock footage clips** that fit the **script’s tone**, **keywords**, and **context**.

**Example**:

* **Footage 1**: Sunrise in the forest (matching the "sun," "birds," "nature" keywords).
* **Footage 2**: Peaceful nature walk (matches positive sentiment and peaceful context).
* **Footage 3**: Birds chirping (matching keywords and positive sentiment).

These video clips can then be automatically inserted into your video project.

---

### **Summary of the Workflow**

1. **Input Script**: The script is provided.
2. **Preprocess Script**: Clean, tokenize, remove stopwords, and lemmatize.
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Extract important keywords using TF-IDF, RAKE, or NER.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Identify the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative).
5. **Contextual Understanding**: Identify the overall context (nature, city, etc.) using topic modeling or word embeddings.
6. **Stock Footage Search**: Query stock footage APIs (e.g., Pexels, Pixabay) based on keywords and context.
7. **Ranking & Selection**: Rank footage by sentiment match, keyword relevance, and contextual fit.
8. **Output**: Provide a list of relevant stock footage clips to use in the video.

By following this workflow, you can automate the process of selecting the right stock footage based on the content and mood of the script, reducing manual effort and increasing the efficiency of


video production.
