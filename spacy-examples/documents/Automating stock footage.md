To solve the problem of automating stock footage selection based on a script, you're dealing with a multi-step NLP and media retrieval pipeline. The workflow you‚Äôve described is solid and modular, and now you're asking:
What is the best tool (or combination of tools) to solve this?
Here's a breakdown of the most suitable tools and frameworks for each part of the pipeline, followed by a recommendation for the best unified tool or tech stack.

‚úÖ Best Tools by Workflow Step
1. Script Input & Preprocessing
Step
Best Tool
Why
Text Parsing & NLP Preprocessing
spaCy
Fast, production-grade, handles tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization, POS tagging.
Alternative
nltk, transformers
Good for educational or fine-grained control but heavier and slower.

2. Keyword Extraction
Method
Best Tool
Why
Statistical (TF-IDF)
scikit-learn
Simple and effective for scripts with structured vocabulary.
Phrase-based
RAKE-NLTK
Good for capturing multi-word key phrases like "sun shining brightly."
Entity-based
spaCy NER
Built-in named entity recognition (e.g., ‚ÄúNew York,‚Äù ‚Äúsun,‚Äù ‚Äúforest‚Äù).
Transformer-based
KeyBERT (with BERT/DistilBERT)
Extracts contextual, semantically rich keywords. Highly recommended.

3. Sentiment Analysis
Best Tool
Why
VADER (from NLTK)
Lightweight, works well for short-form, general-purpose sentiment.
TextBlob
Easy-to-use alternative, also handles subjectivity.
Better Alternative
HuggingFace Transformers (e.g., cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment)

4. Contextual Understanding / Topic Modeling
Approach
Best Tool
Why
LDA
gensim
Classic unsupervised topic modeling, interpretable.
Embeddings
sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
Better for semantic similarity, clustering context.
Clustering
UMAP + HDBSCAN
For grouping similar scripts/topics by embeddings.
Image/Text Matching
CLIP (from OpenAI)
Useful if you want to semantically match text to image/video features.

5. Stock Footage Retrieval
Tool
Why
Pexels API, Pixabay API, Shutterstock API
Ready-made searchable libraries, you can query using keywords.
Search Wrapper
Custom Python script
Advanced
Use CLIP + scraped thumbnails

6. Ranking & Selection
Tool
Why
Custom logic
Python-based ranking using keyword score + sentiment + relevance
Embedding similarity
sentence-transformers or CLIP
