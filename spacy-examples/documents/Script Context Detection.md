Great — you’re thinking ahead! **Understanding the context** of a script is crucial for selecting **theme-relevant stock footage**. Let’s walk through how to do that using:

---

## 🔍 Goal: **Script Context Detection**

To classify context like:

* `🌿 Nature`
* `🏙️ City`
* `🧭 Adventure`
* `🎓 Education`
* `🚗 Travel`
* `👨‍👩‍👧 Family`
* etc.

---

## ✅ Options for Context Detection

### Option 1: **Topic Modeling (LDA or BERTopic)**

* Useful if you have **many scripts** and want to discover topics **unsupervised**.

### Option 2: **Zero-Shot Classification (Recommended)**

* Classify **any single script** into **predefined categories** (e.g., “nature”, “city”) **without training**.

---

## 🚀 Recommended: **Zero-Shot Classification with Transformers**

### Why?

* No need to train.
* Accurate and fast.
* Works for short and long texts.

---

### ✅ Install Requirements

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

---

### 🧠 Sample Code: Context Detection via Zero-Shot Classification

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load zero-shot classifier
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")

def detect_context(script):
    candidate_labels = ["nature", "city", "adventure", "travel", "technology", "education", "family", "romance", "business", "sports"]

    result = classifier(script, candidate_labels)
    top_label = result['labels'][0]
    scores = {label: round(score, 3) for label, score in zip(result['labels'], result['scores'])}

    return {
        "top_context": top_label,
        "confidence_scores": scores
    }

# Test with sample script
script = """
The forest was quiet, and rays of sunlight flickered through the trees. Birds chirped in the distance, and a river trickled over rocks nearby.
"""

context_result = detect_context(script)

print("📌 Detected Context:", context_result['top_context'])
print("🔢 Confidence Scores:", context_result['confidence_scores'])
```

---

### 🧪 Output Example

```plaintext
📌 Detected Context: nature
🔢 Confidence Scores:
{
  'nature': 0.95,
  'travel': 0.87,
  'adventure': 0.84,
  'city': 0.04,
  'technology': 0.01
}
```

This gives you:

* ✅ A **clear dominant theme** (`"nature"`)
* 🔢 A **confidence map** to choose fallback or secondary tags

---

## 💡 Use Case: Tag Your Stock Footage Search

Once you have `"nature"` as your context, you can use it as:

```python
query = f"{context} {' '.join(matching_keywords)}"
```

For example:

```plaintext
"nature sunlight peaceful forest"
```

Used in a stock footage API like Pexels, this increases **relevance**.

---

## 🔄 Bonus: Combine with Sentiment/Emotion

You can combine this with the previous pipeline like:

```python
full_query = f"{detected_context} {' '.join(sentiment_emotion_keywords)}"
```

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

Would you like me to:

* 🔁 Integrate this into the **existing pipeline** you’re building?
* 🧠 Add **topic modeling (LDA/BERTopic)** for batch scripts?
* 🎯 Auto-match **context + sentiment** to a **style template**?

Let me know how advanced you want this to get — we can even make it choose **video templates automatically**.
