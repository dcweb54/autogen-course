Final Workflow: Context Sentiment Emotion Stock Footage Selection

Excellent. Let's now **integrate context detection** into your full **automated stock footage pipeline**, combining:

---

## ✅ Final Workflow: Context + Sentiment + Emotion + Stock Footage Selection

This enhanced pipeline will:

1. Analyze a script for:

   * **Sentiment** (happy, sad, etc.)
   * **Emotion** (joy, calmness, sadness…)
   * **Context** (e.g., nature, city, adventure)
2. Use this information to:

   * Generate highly relevant **search queries**
   * Fetch matching **stock footage** (via Pexels)
   * Fetch **background music** (via Freesound)
3. Use `ffmpeg` to:

   * **Download and edit** videos together
   * **Add matching music**
   * Export the final polished video

## 🧱 Final Structure

Here’s what we’re adding:

### ✅ New Function: `detect_context()`

### ✅ Modified Script to Integrate Everything

---

## 💻 Updated Full Pipeline Code (With Context Detection)

> 🔁 This includes:

* Sentiment/emotion
* **NEW: Context classification**
* Pexels + Freesound API
* `ffmpeg` download + assembly

Awesome! Here’s a more detailed scene segmentation of your passage, breaking it down into clear parts based on shifts in focus or action:


Great! This looks like a narrative passage. When you say scene segmentation, do you want me to break this story into distinct scenes or segments? Like identifying where one scene ends and another begins?


Perfect! Let me help you build a simple **scene segmentation script** using Sentence-BERT embeddings and cosine similarity in Python.

---

### What the script will do:

* Take a list of sentences (your story or text)
* Compute sentence embeddings with Sentence-BERT
* Calculate cosine similarity between consecutive sentences
* Mark scene boundaries where similarity drops below a threshold

---

### Step-by-step script:

```python

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample text split into sentences
sentences = [
    "Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak, a mountain so tall many said it can't be climbed without years of training.",
    "But Alex wasn't an expert.",
    "Just a person with a dream and a backpack full of hope.",
    "The first steps were easy.",
    "The path was clear.",
    "But soon the trail grew steeper.",
    "Rocks blocked the way.",
    "The wind howled.",
    "Doubt crept in."
]

# Load the model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Encode sentences
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)

# Set similarity threshold (you can tune this)
threshold = 0.7

# Initialize list for scene boundaries (indices where a new scene starts)
scene_boundaries = [0]  # First sentence always starts a scene

for i in range(len(sentences)-1):
    sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings[i]], [embeddings[i+1]])[0][0]
    print(f"Similarity between sentence {i} and {i+1}: {sim:.2f}")
    if sim < threshold:
        scene_boundaries.append(i+1)

# Print scenes
print("\nScene Segments:")
for i in range(len(scene_boundaries)):
    start = scene_boundaries[i]
    end = scene_boundaries[i+1] if i+1 < len(scene_boundaries) else len(sentences)
    print(f"\nScene {i+1}:")
    for sentence in sentences[start:end]:
        print(sentence)
```

---

### How to run:

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Run `pip install sentence-transformers scikit-learn`
3. Save the script and run it with `python your_script.py`

---

### What you’ll see:

* Cosine similarity scores printed for each pair of consecutive sentences
* The text divided into scenes where the similarity drops below the threshold

---

Would you like me to help you adapt this to longer texts or add more advanced features like smoothing or windowed similarity?


Awesome! Here’s how we can improve and adapt the script for longer texts and make the segmentation a bit smarter:

---

### 1. **Handle longer texts**

* Instead of just consecutive sentence pairs, use a **sliding window** of sentences to smooth similarity and avoid noise.
* For example, compare embedding of sentence *i* with the average embedding of the next *k* sentences.

---

### 2. **Add smoothing**

* Use a small moving average over similarity scores to reduce abrupt fluctuations.
* Helps avoid too many tiny segments caused by small drops in similarity.

---

### 3. **Example improved script**

```python

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

def segment_text(sentences, model, threshold=0.7, window_size=2):
    embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
    n = len(sentences)
    
    # Precompute average embeddings for sliding windows ahead
    avg_future_embeddings = []
    for i in range(n):
        # Take next window_size sentences or up to end
        end_idx = min(i + window_size, n)
        avg_embedding = np.mean(embeddings[i:end_idx], axis=0)
        avg_future_embeddings.append(avg_embedding)
        
    scene_boundaries = [0]
    
    for i in range(n-1):
        sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings[i]], [avg_future_embeddings[i+1]])[0][0]
        print(f"Similarity between sentence {i} and next window: {sim:.2f}")
        if sim < threshold:
            scene_boundaries.append(i+1)
            
    # Group sentences into scenes
    scenes = []
    for i in range(len(scene_boundaries)):
        start = scene_boundaries[i]
        end = scene_boundaries[i+1] if i+1 < len(scene_boundaries) else n
        scenes.append(sentences[start:end])
        
    return scenes

# Example usage
sentences = [
    "Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak, a mountain so tall many said it can't be climbed without years of training.",
    "But Alex wasn't an expert.",
    "Just a person with a dream and a backpack full of hope.",
    "The first steps were easy.",
    "The path was clear.",
    "But soon the trail grew steeper.",
    "Rocks blocked the way.",
    "The wind howled.",
    "Doubt crept in."
]

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
scenes = segment_text(sentences, model, threshold=0.75, window_size=2)

for i, scene in enumerate(scenes, 1):
    print(f"\nScene {i}:")
    for s in scene:
        print(s)
```

---

### What this does differently:

* Instead of just sentence-to-sentence, compares current sentence embedding to the **average of next 2 sentences**.
* This captures the *overall context* ahead, avoiding small sudden drops causing false breaks.
* You can tweak `threshold` and `window_size` to your text and use case.

---

Want me to help you build this into a full notebook or integrate it with a GUI? Or maybe show you how to do **hierarchical segmentation** (multi-level scenes/sub-scenes)?

Great! Let’s plan a simple but complete pipeline in Python that you can run as a notebook or script. It will:

* Take a long text input
* Split it into sentences (using an NLP library)
* Compute embeddings with Sentence-BERT
* Use the sliding window + threshold method for segmentation
* (Optional) Provide hierarchical segmentation — scenes and sub-scenes
* Output the segments clearly

---

### Here’s a step-by-step example notebook script:

```python
# Step 1: Install needed packages
# !pip install sentence-transformers nltk numpy scikit-learn

import nltk
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Download NLTK sentence tokenizer data (run once)
nltk.download('punkt')

def split_into_sentences(text):
    return nltk.sent_tokenize(text)

def segment_text(sentences, model, threshold=0.75, window_size=2):
    embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
    n = len(sentences)
    
    avg_future_embeddings = []
    for i in range(n):
        end_idx = min(i + window_size, n)
        avg_embedding = np.mean(embeddings[i:end_idx], axis=0)
        avg_future_embeddings.append(avg_embedding)
        
    scene_boundaries = [0]
    
    for i in range(n-1):
        sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings[i]], [avg_future_embeddings[i+1]])[0][0]
        if sim < threshold:
            scene_boundaries.append(i+1)
            
    scenes = []
    for i in range(len(scene_boundaries)):
        start = scene_boundaries[i]
        end = scene_boundaries[i+1] if i+1 < len(scene_boundaries) else n
        scenes.append(sentences[start:end])
        
    return scenes

# Optional: hierarchical segmentation by re-segmenting scenes with higher threshold
def hierarchical_segment(scenes, model, sub_threshold=0.85, window_size=2):
    hierarchical = []
    for scene in scenes:
        if len(scene) <= 3:
            hierarchical.append([scene])  # No sub-scenes for short scenes
        else:
            sub_scenes = segment_text(scene, model, threshold=sub_threshold, window_size=window_size)
            hierarchical.append(sub_scenes)
    return hierarchical

# Example text (you can replace with your own long text)
text = """
Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak, a mountain so tall many said it can't be climbed without years of training. But Alex wasn't an expert. Just a person with a dream and a backpack full of hope. The first steps were easy. The path was clear. But soon the trail grew steeper. Rocks blocked the way. The wind howled. Doubt crept in.
"""

# Run the pipeline
sentences = split_into_sentences(text)
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

scenes = segment_text(sentences, model, threshold=0.75, window_size=2)
hierarchical_scenes = hierarchical_segment(scenes, model, sub_threshold=0.85, window_size=2)

# Print hierarchical scenes
for i, scene in enumerate(hierarchical_scenes, 1):
    print(f"\nScene {i}:")
    for j, sub_scene in enumerate(scene, 1):
        print(f"  Sub-scene {j}:")
        for sentence in sub_scene:
            print(f"    {sentence}")
```

---

### How to use it:

* Replace the `text` variable with your own long narrative.
* Adjust `threshold` and `sub_threshold` to get finer or coarser segmentation.
* Increase `window_size` to smooth even more.
* Run it in a Jupyter notebook or Python script.

---

If you want, I can help package this into a **streamlined notebook with comments**, or help you build a simple web interface where you can paste text and see segments visually.

What do you want to do next?


Great question! 🤖✨

**spaCy** can definitely help with **scene segmentation**, especially as a **preprocessing tool** and for adding **linguistic awareness** to your segmentation pipeline.

---

## ✅ How spaCy Can Help with Scene Segmentation

Here’s how spaCy fits in:

---

### 1. **Sentence Splitting (Tokenization)**

spaCy is excellent at breaking large text into **accurate sentences** (far better than naive `.split('.')`).

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(your_text)

sentences = [sent.text.strip() for sent in doc.sents]
```

➡️ This gives you clean, linguistically-aware sentences to pass into the transformer model.

---

### 2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

spaCy can identify characters, places, and other named entities — which can help identify **scene changes** when:

* A new character appears
* The setting changes (e.g., "in the forest" → "in the city")

Example:

```python
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

➡️ You can track when named entities shift (like characters or locations) as **scene boundaries**.

---

### 3. **Coreference Resolution (via extensions)**

With packages like [`coreferee`](https://github.com/msg-systems/coreferee) or `spacy-coref`, spaCy can resolve **pronouns to actual names** (e.g., “he” → “Alex”).

This helps with:

* Maintaining **character continuity**
* Detecting **new scenes** when focus shifts to different entities

---

### 4. **Part-of-Speech (POS) and Dependency Parsing**

Want to identify when action-heavy sentences start a new scene?

spaCy gives you access to verbs, subjects, etc.

Example:

```python
for token in doc:
    if token.pos_ == 'VERB':
        print(token.text)
```

➡️ Could be used to find **action bursts** that signal a new scene.

---

## 🛠 How to Combine spaCy with Transformers for Scene Segmentation

### ✅ Preprocess with spaCy:

* Clean sentence segmentation
* Detect named entities and shifts

### ✅ Segment with Transformers:

* Use SBERT or another transformer to encode sentences
* Use cosine similarity or clustering to detect semantic shifts

### ✅ Combine insights:

* Use **both semantic similarity + entity/topic shifts** for smarter segmentation

---

## 🔁 Optional Hybrid Strategy

You could define a segmentation rule like:

> Start a new scene if:
>
> * Cosine similarity drops below threshold **OR**
> * A new named person or location appears

---

### 🔍 Want a Demo?

I can give you a combined script using **spaCy + Sentence-BERT** that does this:

1. Sentence segmentation with spaCy
2. Named entity detection
3. Scene segmentation using both SBERT and named entity shifts

Perfect! Here's a full **demo script** that combines:

✅ **spaCy** — for sentence splitting and named entity detection
✅ **Sentence-BERT** — for semantic similarity
✅ **Scene segmentation** — based on either:

* a drop in semantic similarity
* a shift in named entities (e.g., a new person or place)

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Install dependencies (if you haven’t already):

```bash
pip install spacy sentence-transformers scikit-learn
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

---

## 🧠 Full Python Script

```python
import spacy
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Load models
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

def split_sentences(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    return [sent.text.strip() for sent in doc.sents]

def extract_named_entities(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    return set([ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ in ("PERSON", "GPE", "ORG", "LOC")])

def segment_text(sentences, model, sim_threshold=0.75, entity_shift=True):
    embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
    scenes = []
    scene = [sentences[0]]
    prev_entities = extract_named_entities(sentences[0])

    for i in range(1, len(sentences)):
        sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings[i - 1]], [embeddings[i]])[0][0]
        curr_entities = extract_named_entities(sentences[i])

        # Check for entity shift
        entity_changed = len(prev_entities.symmetric_difference(curr_entities)) > 0

        # Trigger new scene
        if sim < sim_threshold or (entity_shift and entity_changed):
            scenes.append(scene)
            scene = [sentences[i]]
        else:

# === EXAMPLE USAGE ===

text = """
Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak, a mountain so tall many said it can't be climbed without years of training.
But Alex wasn't an expert. Just a person with a dream and a backpack full of hope.
The first steps were easy. The path was clear.
But soon the trail grew steeper. Rocks blocked the way. The wind howled. Doubt crept in.
Later, in the village below, Maria waited with binoculars, scanning the peak.
She had warned Alex about the danger. Now she feared the worst.
"""

sentences = split_sentences(text)
scenes = segment_text(sentences, model, sim_threshold=0.75, entity_shift=True)

# === PRINT RESULTS ===
for i, scene in enumerate(scenes, 1):
    print(f"\n🟦 Scene {i}:")
    for sentence in scene:
        print(f"   {sentence}")
```

### 🔍 What It Does:

* Breaks text into sentences with **spaCy**
* Extracts **named entities** from each sentence
* Segments scenes if:

  * Semantic similarity between two sentences drops below `0.75`, OR
  * Named entities change (e.g., new person or location appears)

---

### ⚙️ Customization Tips:

| Setting         | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `sim_threshold` | Lower = fewer segments, higher = more      |
| `entity_shift`  | Turn off if you only want similarity-based |

---

### ✅ Output Example (based on sample text above):

```
🟦 Scene 1:
   Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak...
   But Alex wasn't an expert...
   The first steps were easy...
   But soon the trail grew steeper...

🟦 Scene 2:
   Later, in the village below, Maria waited with binoculars...
   She had warned Alex about the danger...
```

Would you like this turned into a Jupyter notebook with visualization (like horizontal lines or collapsible sections per scene)?


Great — now it's clear. ✅

### 🎬 Your Goal:

You're using **scene segmentation** to analyze a **script or story**, so you can find or match the **best footage** (e.g., for film editing, shot planning, AI-generated video, or stock video search).

So instead of just breaking text for reading, you're aiming to:

---

## 🧠 Align Scenes in Script ⟶ Best Visual Footage

Let’s outline the purpose-driven approach:

---

### ✅ What You Want From Scene Segmentation:

| Goal                                  | How Segmentation Helps                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Understand narrative units**        | Break the story into scenes where the action, setting, or character focus shifts |
| **Match text to video footage**       | Each scene gives keywords or descriptions you can match with clips               |
| **Guide video generation or editing** | Use each scene as a prompt or input block                                        |

---

## 💡 Ideal Workflow

1. **Input your script**
2. **Scene segmentation** (using semantic + entity shifts)
3. For each scene:

   * Extract **key elements**: people, places, action verbs
   * Build **descriptive prompts** or **footage search tags**
4. (Optional) Match with:

   * AI video generation models (e.g., Runway, Pika)
   * Stock video APIs (e.g., Pexels, Storyblocks)
   * Editing timelines

---

## 🔧 Enhanced Script (Scene ➝ Footage Prompts)

Here's a full working example that:

* Segments the script
* Extracts keywords per scene
* Builds prompts to search for or generate matching footage

```python
import spacy
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Load models
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

def split_sentences(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    return [sent.text.strip() for sent in doc.sents]

def extract_keywords(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    people = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON"]
    places = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ in ("GPE", "LOC")]
    actions = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if token.pos_ == "VERB"]
    return list(set(people)), list(set(places)), list(set(actions))

def segment_text(sentences, model, sim_threshold=0.75, entity_shift=True):
    embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
    scenes = []
    scene = [sentences[0]]
    prev_entities = extract_keywords(sentences[0])[0] + extract_keywords(sentences[0])[1]

    for i in range(1, len(sentences)):
        sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings[i - 1]], [embeddings[i]])[0][0]
        curr_entities = extract_keywords(sentences[i])[0] + extract_keywords(sentences[i])[1]
        entity_changed = len(set(prev_entities).symmetric_difference(curr_entities)) > 0

        if sim < sim_threshold or (entity_shift and entity_changed):
            scenes.append(scene)
            scene = [sentences[i]]
        else:
            scene.append(sentences[i])

        prev_entities = curr_entities

    if scene:
        scenes.append(scene)

    return scenes

def build_footage_prompt(scene):
    full_text = " ".join(scene)
    people, places, actions = extract_keywords(full_text)
    prompt_parts = []

    if people:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Character(s): {', '.join(people)}")
    if places:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Setting: {', '.join(places)}")
    if actions:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Actions: {', '.join(actions)}")

    prompt = " | ".join(prompt_parts)
    return prompt

# === INPUT TEXT ===

    print(f"\n🎬 Scene {i}:")
    print(" ".join(scene))
    print(f"📷 Footage Prompt: {build_footage_prompt(scene)}")
```

### 🧠 Sample Output:

```
🎬 Scene 1:
Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak...
📷 Footage Prompt: Character(s): Alex | Setting: Eagle's Peak | Actions: dream, climb

🎬 Scene 2:
The first steps were easy. The path was clear.
📷 Footage Prompt: Actions: be

🎬 Scene 3:
But soon the trail grew steeper...
📷 Footage Prompt: Actions: grow, block, howl, creep

🎬 Scene 4:
Later, in the village below, Maria waited...
📷 Footage Prompt: Character(s): Maria, Alex | Setting: village | Actions: wait, scan, fear, warn
```

## 🧰 Next Steps

You can now take these prompts and:

* 🔍 **Search for footage** on:

  * [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/)
  * [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)
  * [Runway / Pika / Genmo](https://runwayml.com) for **AI video generation**

* 🎞️ **Use it in editing software** to tag or label timelines

* 🤖 **Use LLMs or vision models** to generate matching clips using prompt-to-video tools

---

Would you like:

* A version that connects to a stock footage API?
* A web app or notebook interface?
* Export to CSV or video-editing timeline?

Let me know how you'd like to use it in your workflow.

Perfect — you're aiming to use **scene segmentation + prompts** to help build or enhance a **video editing timeline**. This is a very practical and powerful use case. Let’s break it down into what you can do — and then I’ll show you a basic implementation.

---

## 🎞️ Goal: Build a Video Editing Timeline from Script

You want to convert your **script** into structured **timeline blocks**, something like this:

| Scene # | Start Time | End Time | Script Segment       | Footage Prompt                  |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1       | 00:00:00   | 00:00:12 | "Alex had always..." | "Climbing a mountain, Alex..."  |
| 2       | 00:00:12   | 00:00:30 | "The first steps..." | "Trail walking, forest path..." |
| ...     | ...        | ...      | ...                  | ...                             |

You can then:

* Use this as a **planning timeline** for editing
* Or feed it into **video editing software** like **Adobe Premiere**, **DaVinci Resolve**, or **Final Cut Pro**

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Segment the script into scenes (✔️ Done earlier)

### ✅ Step 2: Build prompts from each scene (✔️ Done)

### ✅ Step 3: Assign estimated durations (optional)

You can:

* Use fixed durations (e.g. 10 seconds per scene)
* Or estimate based on sentence count or word count

### ✅ Step 4: Export to timeline format

Common formats:

* **CSV/Excel** for planning
* **EDL/FCXML/OTIO** for professional editors
* **JSON** for APIs or tools

---

## 📄 Let’s Start with a Simple CSV Timeline Export

Here’s a Python script that takes your **segmented scenes** and exports a **timeline CSV**:

```python
import csv
import spacy
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Load models
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

def split_sentences(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    return [sent.text.strip() for sent in doc.sents]

def extract_keywords(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    people = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON"]
    places = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ in ("GPE", "LOC")]
    actions = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if token.pos_ == "VERB"]
    return list(set(people)), list(set(places)), list(set(actions))

    embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
    scenes = []
    scene = [sentences[0]]

    for i in range(1, len(sentences)):
        sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings[i - 1]], [embeddings[i]])[0][0]
        if sim < sim_threshold:
            scenes.append(scene)
            scene = [sentences[i]]
        else:
            scene.append(sentences[i])
    if scene:
        scenes.append(scene)

    return scenes

def build_footage_prompt(scene):
    full_text = " ".join(scene)
    people, places, actions = extract_keywords(full_text)
    prompt_parts = []

    if people:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Character(s): {', '.join(people)}")
    if places:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Setting: {', '.join(places)}")
    if actions:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Actions: {', '.join(actions)}")

    return " | ".join(prompt_parts)

def seconds_to_timestamp(seconds):
    h = seconds // 3600
    m = (seconds % 3600) // 60
    s = seconds % 60
    return f"{int(h):02}:{int(m):02}:{int(s):02}"

def export_timeline_csv(scenes, output_file="timeline.csv", default_duration=10):
    with open(output_file, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow(["Scene #", "Start Time", "End Time", "Script Segment", "Footage Prompt"])

        current_time = 0
        for i, scene in enumerate(scenes, 1):
            start_time = seconds_to_timestamp(current_time)
            duration = default_duration + len(" ".join(scene)) // 50  # adjust based on length
            end_time = seconds_to_timestamp(current_time + duration)
            prompt = build_footage_prompt(scene)
            script_text = " ".join(scene)
            writer.writerow([i, start_time, end_time, script_text, prompt])
            current_time += duration

## 🧾 Output: `video_timeline.csv`

| Scene # | Start Time | End Time | Script Segment            | Footage Prompt                    |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

You can import this into:

* **Google Sheets / Excel** — for planning
* **DaVinci Resolve / Adobe Premiere** — using tools like [OTIO](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO) to convert to EDL/XML

---

## 🚀 Next Steps: Want to go further?

I can help you:

* ✅ Export to **OpenTimelineIO (OTIO)** format for professional tools
* 🖼️ Use AI to generate **placeholder footage** per scene
* 🌐 Build a **web-based visual timeline editor**
* 🔗 Integrate with footage libraries (e.g. Pexels, Pixabay) or AI video tools

Would you like to try exporting to an **editing format** like OTIO or just stick with CSV for now?
