Great question. **Sentence-Transformers (SBERT)** is a powerful library designed for turning sentences into **dense embeddings** that capture semantic meaning. This allows you to measure **how similar two sentences or passages are**, among many other tasks.

In your case — **scene segmentation for video editing** — you can use Sentence-Transformers to detect **semantic changes** in the script that indicate scene shifts. But that’s just the beginning.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases of Sentence-Transformers in Your Workflow

Let’s focus on practical, high-impact uses **relevant to your script + footage pipeline**:

---

### ✅ 1. **Scene Segmentation Based on Semantic Shifts**

This is what we’ve already done:

* Convert each sentence to an embedding
* Measure cosine similarity between consecutive sentences
* When similarity drops, a new **scene** begins

✔️ **Detects story structure automatically**
✔️ Avoids needing manual cue words like “Scene 1:”

---

### ✅ 2. **Footage Matching via Semantic Search**

**Problem**: You want to find footage that "feels like" a scene from your script — not just based on keywords.

**Solution**:

* Encode your scene using SBERT
* Encode your footage descriptions or transcripts (or use pre-embedded metadata if available)
* Use cosine similarity to find the **best-matching clip**

```python
scene_embedding = model.encode("Alex climbs a snowy mountain.")
clip_embedding = model.encode("A person hiking through snow-covered peaks.")
cos_sim = cosine_similarity([scene_embedding], [clip_embedding])[0][0]
```

✔️ Works even when words don't match but **meaning does**

---

### ✅ 3. **Generate Tags or Prompts with Similarity Clustering**

Use embeddings to group similar scenes together, e.g.:

* All "Alex climbing" moments
* All "Maria waiting" scenes

You can do this using **clustering algorithms** on SBERT embeddings:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
clusters = KMeans(n_clusters=3).fit(embeddings)
```

✔️ Helps for bulk-tagging or organizing scenes

---

### ✅ 4. **Summarize or Label Scenes Using Embeddings**

Want to generate short labels like:

* “Mountain Climb”
* “Village Waits”
* “Danger Approaches”

You can:

* Use Sentence-Transformer + clustering
* Or feed embeddings into a **captioning model** or **prompt to LLM**

---

### ✅ 5. **Visual Similarity for Shot Matching**

If you have **frame-level descriptions or transcripts** of footage (or AI-generated captions), you can:

* Embed each shot using SBERT
* Embed your script scene
* Retrieve **top-N best-matching shots** for that scene

This is how companies like **Runway, ElevenLabs Video**, etc. align text-to-video.

---

## 🔧 Models You Can Use

Here are some SBERT models you can plug into your pipeline:

| Model                  | Size       | Good For                 | Model Name                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  | small      | Fast, good all-purpose   | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  |
| 🧠 `all-mpnet-base-v2` | medium     | Best quality overall     | `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` |
| 🧠 `clip-ViT-B-32`     | image+text | Matching visual captions | `sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32`     |

---

## 🛠 How to Install & Use Sentence-Transformers

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers
```

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

sent1 = "Alex climbs the mountain."
sent2 = "A man hikes up a steep hill."

emb1 = model.encode(sent1)
emb2 = model.encode(sent2)

similarity = cosine_similarity([emb1], [emb2])[0][0]
print("Similarity:", similarity)
```

---

## 🧠 Summary: Why Use Sentence-Transformers?

| Use Case           | How it Helps                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Scene segmentation | Detects meaningful shifts in story flow |
| Shot matching      | Finds relevant footage by meaning       |
| Clustering scenes  | Groups similar narrative elements       |
| Smart prompting    | Turns scenes into captions or tags      |
| Faster indexing    | Embed once, search forever              |

## 🔍 Next Step?

Would you like:

1. A code demo to **embed and match your script to a library of video shots**?
2. A way to **generate storyboards or summaries** using SBERT?
3. A tutorial on **build




Perfect — let’s build **a tool that uses SBERT to generate storyboards or summaries** from a script. This will let you:

---

## 🎬 What You’ll Get

* ✅ **Scene segmentation** from your script
* ✅ **Automatic summary / caption** of each scene
* ✅ Optional: **prompt generation** for DALL·E, Midjourney, or Runway to visualize the scene

---

## 🧠 How This Works (Conceptually)

1. **Split** the script into sentences
2. **Segment** into scenes (based on SBERT similarity)
3. For each scene:

   * Use **SBERT to embed the scene**
   * Find the most **representative sentence** (summary)
   * Generate a **prompt** for visual tools (e.g., DALL·E / Midjourney)
4. Export the output as a **storyboard-ready format**

Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak, a mountain so tall many said it can't be climbed without years of training.
But Alex wasn't an expert. Just a person with a dream and a backpack full of hope.
The first steps were easy. The path was clear.
But soon the trail grew steeper. Rocks blocked the way. The wind howled. Doubt crept in.
Later, in the village below, Maria waited with binoculars, scanning the peak.
She had warned Alex about the danger. Now she feared the worst.

## ▶️ How to Use This

### 🔹 Step 1: Save your script as `script.txt`

Example contents:

```
Alex had always dreamed of reaching the top of Eagle's Peak...
...
Maria waited in the village, scanning the mountain.
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Run this pipeline

```python
with open("script.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    script_text = f.read()

storyboard = make_storyboard(script_text)
save_prompts_to_file(storyboard, PROMPT_FILE)

# ⏳ Now load prompts.txt in Fooocus and generate images
print("\n🎨 Open Fooocus > Batch mode > Load 'prompts.txt' > Generate images")
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Generate Images in Fooocus

* Open **Fooocus**
* Go to **Batch Mode**
* Load the `prompts.txt` file
* Set output size to **512x512** or match `IMAGE_SIZE`
* Run batch image generation

Fooocus will save images like:

```
outputs/00001.png
outputs/00002.png
...
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Generate Storyboard PDF

After images are ready:

```python
generate_storyboard_pdf(storyboard, image_dir=IMAGE_DIR, output_pdf=STORYBOARD_PDF)
```

You'll get:

```
📄 storyboard.pdf
```

Each page contains:

* ✅ Scene number
* ✅ Text summary
* ✅ Full scene text
* ✅ Generated image

---

## ✅ You Now Have:

* [x] AI scene segmentation (SBERT)
* [x] Scene summaries
* [x] Visual prompts
* [x] Batch AI image generation (Fooocus)
* [x] Exported storyboard PDF

---

## ✨ Want to Extend This?

You can also:

* 📤 Export to HTML or PowerPoint
* 🧪 Add style presets (e.g., "anime", "film noir")
* 🤖 Use DALL·E or Runway via API instead of Fooocus
* 🎥 Turn storyboard into animatic with audio + text-to-video tools
