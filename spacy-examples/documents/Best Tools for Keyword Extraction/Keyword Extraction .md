Exactly ‚Äî you've nailed the purpose of **keyword extraction** in this workflow.

Let me break it down a bit more technically and practically to clarify **why it's so critical**, and **how to do it well**, especially for **automated stock footage selection**.

---

## üîç **Why Keyword Extraction Matters**

In the context of **stock footage automation**, keyword extraction is used to:

1. **Identify key visual concepts** mentioned in the script.
2. Convert natural language into **searchable terms** for stock footage APIs.
3. Increase **retrieval precision**, ensuring relevant video clips are suggested.
4. Help with **ranking and filtering** later in the pipeline (e.g., matching sentiment or context).

## üéØ Example

### **Script:**

> "The sun was shining brightly, and the birds were chirping in the trees. It was a peaceful day."

### **Raw Text ‚Üí Keywords:**

| Extracted Keyword | Stock Footage Relevance                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sun`             | Sunrise, sunlight videos                                               |
| `birds`           | Bird flying, chirping                                                  |
| `trees`           | Forest, nature scenes                                                  |
| `peaceful`        | Mood-based filtering (e.g., calm background music, slow-motion nature) |

These become the **search queries** to an API like:

```
query: "sun birds forest"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Tools for Keyword Extraction (with Code Examples)

### ‚úÖ 1. **KeyBERT** (Highly Recommended)

Uses **BERT embeddings** to extract context-aware keywords or phrases.

```python
from keybert import KeyBERT

kw_model = KeyBERT('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

script = """The sun was shining brightly, and the birds were chirping in the trees. It was a peaceful day."""

keywords = kw_model.extract_keywords(script, top_n=5)
print(keywords)
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
[('sun shining', 0.78), ('birds chirping', 0.74), ('peaceful day', 0.71)]
```

This is **ready to use as a query** for stock footage.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)**

Simple and fast, based on frequency and co-occurrence.

```python
from rake_nltk import Rake

rake = Rake()
rake.extract_keywords_from_text(script)
keywords = rake.get_ranked_phrases()
print(keywords)
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
['sun shining brightly', 'birds chirping', 'peaceful day']
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **spaCy + POS Filtering + NER**

You can extract **nouns, adjectives, and named entities** manually.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(script)

keywords = [token.text for token in doc if token.pos_ in ["NOUN", "PROPN", "ADJ"] and not token.is_stop]
print(keywords)
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
['sun', 'birds', 'trees', 'peaceful', 'day']
```

---

## üß† Pro Tip: Combine Methods

You can get **more robust keywords** by **combining outputs**:

* RAKE + KeyBERT ‚Üí Capture both statistical and contextual terms.
* Filter out generic ones ("day", "thing") with a domain-specific stopword list.
* Add `NER` for location-based footage ("New York", "Himalayas", etc.)

---

## üß∞ Final Use: Formulating API Queries

Use the final keywords to make search queries:

```python
query = "sun birds forest nature peaceful"
```

Then call:

```python
requests.get(
    "https://api.pexels.com/videos/search",
    headers={"Authorization": PEXELS_API_KEY},
    params={"query": query, "per_page": 5}
)
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature           | Recommendation                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Best Tool         | **KeyBERT** (for contextual keywords)            |
| Quick Alternative | RAKE or spaCy POS Filtering                      |
| Use Case          | Turn script ‚Üí search terms for footage           |
| Enhancement       | Combine with sentiment/context to refine queries |

Would you like a script that wraps this into a **function** that returns ready-to-query keywords from any script?
