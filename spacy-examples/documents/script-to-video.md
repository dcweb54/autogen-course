Great â€” you're essentially describing a **script-to-video search tool**, where you:

1. **Input a script or text**
2. **Break it down into scenes or keywords**
3. **Search each scene on a stock video site like Pixabay**
4. **Download or collect relevant footage**

This is very achievable with a combination of:

* **Sentence Transformers** (to encode and compare meaning)
* **Scene splitting** (simple sentence segmentation or AI-based scene detection)
* **Pixabay API** (to search and retrieve footage)

---

## âœ… Here's a High-Level Workflow

### 1. **Script Segmentation**

Break your script into **individual scenes or meaningful sentences**.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

script = """A man walks through a misty forest. He hears a wolf howling in the distance."""
scenes = sent_tokenize(script)  # Splits into individual scene descriptions
```

---

### 2. **Scene Embedding (Optional for similarity ranking)**

Use `sentence-transformers` to convert each scene into embeddings for semantic search.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
scene_embeddings = model.encode(scenes)
```

---

### 3. **Search for Footage on Pixabay**

Use the **Pixabay API** to search for each scene keyword or phrase.

ðŸ“Œ You'll need an API key: [https://pixabay.com/api/docs/](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)

```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'YOUR_PIXABAY_API_KEY'
def search_pixabay(query):
    url = f"https://pixabay.com/api/videos/?key={API_KEY}&q={query}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()['hits']

# Example usage:
results = search_pixabay("misty forest")
for video in results:
    print(video['videos']['medium']['url'])  # or other sizes
```

---

### 4. **(Optional) Enhance Search Keywords**

You could also enhance search queries using **keyword extraction** or even **caption simplification**:

```python
from keybert import KeyBERT

kw_model = KeyBERT(model)
for scene in scenes:
    keywords = kw_model.extract_keywords(scene, top_n=2)
    print(keywords)
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus: Ranking Results by Similarity (using embeddings)

To make the search **semantic**, you could:

1. Embed scene description
2. Embed all titles/descriptions returned by Pixabay
3. Rank them by cosine similarity

This gives **smarter matching**, beyond exact keywords.

## ðŸš€ Do You Want a Ready-to-Use Python Script?

If you want, I can write a full working script that:

* Takes a script as input
* Splits it into scenes
* Searches each scene on Pixabay
* Outputs video links or downloads them

Just let me know:

* Do you want **Python only**, or also a **GUI/streamlit/web app**?
* Should it **download videos**, or just display links?
* Do you already have a **Pixabay API key**?

Let me know and Iâ€™ll tailor the code for you.
