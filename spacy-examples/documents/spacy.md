That‚Äôs a great idea ‚Äî you‚Äôre essentially building a **context-aware image suggestion tool** for video creation, using Pixabay and **Sentence Transformers** for semantic understanding. This can help scriptwriters and video editors find matching visuals in real-time while writing a script.

---

### üß† Idea Overview

You want to:

* Input: A **script** or **sentences**
* Process: Use **Sentence Transformers** to understand the meaning
* Output: Fetch **relevant images** from **Pixabay API** based on semantic similarity
* Optional: Compose a **video** automatically or semi-automatically from selected images

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### 1. **Input Handling**

* Take real-time or batch input of script lines.
* Tokenize or segment into sentences or phrases.

### 2. **Sentence Embedding**

* Use a pre-trained **SentenceTransformer** model like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to embed each sentence.

  ```python
  from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
  model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
  sentence_embedding = model.encode("A man walks through a forest at dusk")
  ```

### 3. **Search Pixabay with Keywords**

* Extract **semantic keywords** from sentence (e.g., via:

  * Named Entity Recognition
  * RAKE (keyword extraction)
  * KeyBERT (you can even use sentence-transformers for this)
* Use keywords to **query the Pixabay API**:

  ```python
  import requests

  def search_pixabay(api_key, query, per_page=3):
      url = f"https://pixabay.com/api/?key={api_key}&q={query}&image_type=photo&per_page={per_page}"
      response = requests.get(url)
      return response.json()['hits']
  ```

### 4. **Context Matching (Optional but Powerful)**

* For more precision, embed the **titles/descriptions** of Pixabay results and **rank** them by cosine similarity to your sentence embedding:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

  def rank_images(sentence_embedding, image_data):
      titles = [img['tags'] for img in image_data]
      title_embeddings = model.encode(titles)
      similarities = cosine_similarity([sentence_embedding], title_embeddings)[0]
      ranked = sorted(zip(image_data, similarities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
      return [img for img, _ in ranked]
  ```

### 5. **Visual Keyboard / UI**

* Build a **keyboard-style UI** (could be web-based or an overlay in your editor) that:

  * Shows image suggestions per sentence
  * Allows quick insert or tag selection
  * Supports drag-drop into a timeline or storyboard

---

## üîÑ Optional: Video Builder

Once images are selected, you can generate a video from the script + images using tools like:

* **FFmpeg**
* **MoviePy (Python)**

```python
from moviepy.editor import ImageClip, concatenate_videoclips

def build_video(image_paths, duration_per_image=3):
    clips = [ImageClip(img).set_duration(duration_per_image) for img in image_paths]
    video = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="compose")
    video.write_videofile("output_video.mp4", fps=24)
```

---

## üîë Key Tools & Libraries

| Purpose            | Tool                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Sentence Embedding | `sentence-transformers`                         |
| Keyword Extraction | `KeyBERT`, `spaCy`, `RAKE`                      |
| Pixabay Search     | Pixabay REST API                                |
| Image Ranking      | `scikit-learn` cosine similarity                |
| UI                 | Web (React, Electron), or custom desktop widget |
| Video Creation     | `MoviePy`, `FFmpeg`                             |

---

## ‚ö° Quick Example Flow

1. **Input Sentence**: ‚ÄúA child runs through a sunflower field.‚Äù
2. **Extracted Keywords**: ‚Äúchild‚Äù, ‚Äúsunflower‚Äù, ‚Äúfield‚Äù
3. **Pixabay Search**: Run query with those keywords
4. **Rank**: Compare title/tags of images to sentence embedding
5. **UI**: Show top 5 images as clickable suggestions
6. **Build Video**: Export sequence with selected images

Would you like me to help you:

* Create a **starter script or prototype**?
* Build a **web UI concept**?
* Create a **workflow diagram**?
  Let me know how far along you are.


To use **spaCy** for turning a **script (text)** into something **visual**, like a diagram or graph of its linguistic structure, named entities, or relationships between parts of the text, you can follow these general steps:

---

### üîß 1. **Install spaCy and Dependencies**

```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Optional for visualization:

```bash
pip install spacy[lookups]  # for some visual features
```

---

### üìú 2. **Process Your Script (Text)**

```python
import spacy

# Load the English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Your script (or part of it)
script_text = """
John walks into the room. He looks around and sees a dusty old piano.
Suddenly, he starts playing a melancholic tune.
"""

# Process it with spaCy
doc = nlp(script_text)
```

---

### üîç 3. **Visualize Linguistic Features**

#### Option A: **Dependency Parse Tree** (for sentence structure)

```python
from spacy import displacy

# Visualize one sentence at a time
displacy.render(doc, style="dep", jupyter=True)  # use in Jupyter Notebook

# OR serve in browser
displacy.serve(doc, style="dep")
```

---

#### Option B: **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

```python
displacy.render(doc, style="ent", jupyter=True)

# OR serve in browser
displacy.serve(doc, style="ent")
```

This will highlight people, places, dates, etc.

---

### üß† 4. **What Can You Visualize with spaCy?**

| Type   | What it shows                                                                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dep`  | Syntax tree (dependencies, parts of speech)                                              |
| `ent`  | Named entities (like "John", "New York", "Monday")                                       |
| Custom | You can extract relationships and visualize with tools like `networkx`, `graphviz`, etc. |

---

### üé® 5. **Going Further ‚Äì Custom Visuals**

If you want to make visuals **beyond spaCy‚Äôs built-in tools**, you can extract data and use other libraries.

#### Example: Visualizing Character Interactions in a Script

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extract characters (e.g., named entities labeled as PERSON)
characters = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON"]

# Count co-occurrence in sentences
from collections import Counter
import itertools

pairs = []
for sent in doc.sents:
    persons = [ent.text for ent in sent.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON"]
    pairs.extend(itertools.combinations(set(persons), 2))

pair_freq = Counter(pairs)

# Create graph
G = nx.Graph()
for (p1, p2), freq in pair_freq.items():
    G.add_edge(p1, p2, weight=freq)

# Draw
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=2000, font_size=10)
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels={(u, v): d["weight"] for u, v, d in G.edges(data=True)})
plt.title("Character Co-occurrence Graph")
plt.show()
```

Would you like a specific type of visualization (like emotion arcs, scene changes, character maps)? I can tailor the code accordingly.

Great ‚Äî you're looking to **create a "keyboard" or structured UI (likely a visual or interactive tool)** that helps you **search for footage** based on the **script‚Äôs content and context**.

Let's break this down and clarify what you‚Äôre aiming for, and then I‚Äôll walk you through how to get there using **spaCy + your script + structured tagging/metadata**.

---

## üß© What You‚Äôre Trying to Build: A "Script Keyboard"

You want a **tool/interface** that lets you:

* Browse or search **footage (video clips)** using:

  * **Keywords** (e.g., "John enters room", "gunshot", "dark alley")
  * **Context** (e.g., **scene**, **character**, **emotion**, **location**, **action**)
* Possibly powered by NLP (spaCy), extracting entities, actions, etc.

This is often called a **semantic search keyboard** or **tag-based footage finder** ‚Äî widely used in film post-production and AI-assisted editing workflows.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide

### üìÅ Step 1: Parse Your Script into Structured Data

We'll extract key tags from your script using **spaCy**, and store them in a format like JSON or CSV.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

script = """
INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT

John enters cautiously. A creaking sound echoes.
He lights a match. Shadows dance on the walls.

Suddenly, a loud BANG.
"""

doc = nlp(script)

# Extract sentences and entities/actions
structured_script = []

for sent in doc.sents:
    entry = {
        "sentence": sent.text,
        "characters": [ent.text for ent in sent.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON"],
        "locations": [ent.text for ent in sent.ents if ent.label_ in ["GPE", "LOC", "FAC"]],
        "actions": [token.lemma_ for token in sent if token.pos_ == "VERB"],
        "nouns": [token.lemma_ for token in sent if token.pos_ == "NOUN"],
        "raw": sent.text
    }
    structured_script.append(entry)
```

---

### üß∑ Step 2: Build a "Keyboard" UI with Tags

Now you turn that data into **searchable UI buttons**, such as:

```
[ John ] [ enter ] [ dark room ] [ night ] [ match ] [ bang ] [ creaking ]
```

You can do this in:

* **Python (Streamlit or Gradio)** ‚Äî fast and simple
* **Web UI (HTML/JS + Flask backend)** ‚Äî more flexible
* **Premiere/Resolve panels** (if targeting pro tools) ‚Äî more advanced

#### Example: Streamlit App

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

```python
# app.py
import streamlit as st

# Load structured_script from earlier step

st.title("Script Keyboard - Search Footage")

# Collect unique tags
all_actions = set()
all_characters = set()
all_nouns = set()
for entry in structured_script:
    all_actions.update(entry["actions"])
    all_characters.update(entry["characters"])
    all_nouns.update(entry["nouns"])

selected_actions = st.multiselect("Actions", sorted(all_actions))
selected_characters = st.multiselect("Characters", sorted(all_characters))
selected_objects = st.multiselect("Objects/Keywords", sorted(all_nouns))

# Filter sentences
results = []
for entry in structured_script:
    if all(a in entry["actions"] for a in selected_actions) and \
       all(c in entry["characters"] for c in selected_characters) and \
       all(o in entry["nouns"] for o in selected_objects):
        results.append(entry["sentence"])

st.subheader("Matching Script Lines")
for r in results:
    st.write("- " + r)
```

Then run with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

### üìº Step 3: Link Script Segments to Footage

If you have your **script mapped to video clips** (e.g., timecodes or scene numbers), you can extend each entry:

```python
entry = {
    "scene_id": "Scene_5",
    "timecode": "00:05:12",
    "video_clip": "dark_room_scene.mp4",
    ...
}
```

Then you can make each result in the UI a **clickable video preview** or search link.

---

## üîç Optional Enhancements

| Feature              | Tool                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Emotion detection    | `transformers` (BERT-based sentiment)     |
| Scene classification | Use scene headings like `INT.`, `EXT.`    |
| Speaker detection    | Rule-based from dialogue blocks           |
| Searchable metadata  | Elasticsearch or vector database          |
| Visual map           | Use `displacy`, `Plotly`, or even `d3.js` |

---

## üß† TL;DR

To build a **context-aware script keyboard for footage search**:

1. **Use spaCy** to extract entities, verbs, nouns, locations from your script.
2. Store it as structured data (JSON/CSV).
3. Build a UI (e.g., Streamlit or Web) that allows **tag-based searching**.
4. Link results to **footage metadata** (clips, timecodes, scene numbers).
5. Optional: Enhance with sentiment, scene detection, or dialog tags.

---

Would you like me to generate a working Streamlit demo for this (with dummy video links), or help with integration into a specific platform (like DaVinci Resolve or Premiere)?


Perfect ‚Äî you're asking the **right question**: *‚ÄúHow do I actually **build** this kind of footage-search keyboard tool from scratch?‚Äù*

Let‚Äôs break it down into **clear stages**, so you understand **what you're building**, **why it matters**, and **how it all fits together** ‚Äî even if you're not an expert coder yet.

---

## üß± 1. Core Idea: What Are You Building?

You're building a **tool that helps you search through footage using the script's content** ‚Äî not just by keyword, but by **context**, like:

* **Who** is in the scene (characters)
* **What** is happening (actions)
* **Where** it's set (locations)
* **How** it feels (mood or tone)
* **When** it occurs (scene, day/night)

This is like a **smart search keyboard**, powered by the script.

---

## üõ† 3. Step-by-Step Build Overview

Here‚Äôs a full breakdown:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Load & Parse Your Script

Your script might look like this:

```
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Sarah enters with a knife in her hand.
John looks up from the table, startled.
```

You parse it using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

script = """
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Sarah enters with a knife in her hand.
John looks up from the table, startled.
"""

doc = nlp(script)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Extract Keywords, Characters, and Actions

```python
structured = []

for sent in doc.sents:
    structured.append({
        "sentence": sent.text,
        "characters": [ent.text for ent in sent.ents if ent.label_ == "PERSON"],
        "actions": [token.lemma_ for token in sent if token.pos_ == "VERB"],
        "objects": [token.lemma_ for token in sent if token.pos_ == "NOUN"]
    })
```

Now you have something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "sentence": "Sarah enters with a knife in her hand.",
    "characters": ["Sarah"],
    "actions": ["enter"],
    "objects": ["knife", "hand"]
  }
]
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Build a Searchable UI (Using Streamlit)

Install Streamlit:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Then write this `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Let's pretend this is your structured data from step 2
structured = [
    {"sentence": "Sarah enters with a knife in her hand.",
     "characters": ["Sarah"],
     "actions": ["enter"],
     "objects": ["knife", "hand"]},
    
    {"sentence": "John looks up from the table, startled.",
     "characters": ["John"],
     "actions": ["look"],
     "objects": ["table"]}
]

# Collect unique tags
all_characters = sorted(set(c for line in structured for c in line['characters']))
all_actions = sorted(set(a for line in structured for a in line['actions']))
all_objects = sorted(set(o for line in structured for o in line['objects']))

st.title("Script Keyboard - Search by Tags")

# Tag filters
selected_chars = st.multiselect("Characters", all_characters)
selected_actions = st.multiselect("Actions", all_actions)
selected_objects = st.multiselect("Objects", all_objects)

# Filter logic
results = []
for line in structured:
    if all(c in line["characters"] for c in selected_chars) and \
       all(a in line["actions"] for a in selected_actions) and \
       all(o in line["objects"] for o in selected_objects):
        results.append(line["sentence"])

# Show results
st.subheader("Matching Lines")
for r in results:
    st.write("‚Ä¢", r)
```

Then run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

‚úÖ You now have a basic **interactive keyboard** that lets you search lines of your script by clicking on **tags** (characters, actions, objects).

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Connect to Footage (Metadata Mapping)

This part depends on how your video files are stored.

You need to **map each script sentence** or **scene** to a file:

```python
# Add this to each structured entry
"video_file": "scene_4.mp4",
"timecode": "00:01:32"
```

Then in your UI, when a line appears, you can show:

```python
st.video("path/to/scene_4.mp4", start_time=92)  # start at 1:32
```

Or just show a link/button:

```python
st.markdown("[Play Scene 4](path/to/scene_4.mp4)")
```

## üìå Recap: You‚Äôre Building‚Ä¶

A tool that:

* üß† **Reads the script**
* üîç **Breaks it down into search tags**
* üéõÔ∏è **Lets you interactively search lines**
* üìº **Links back to actual footage**

---

Would you like:

1. A ready-to-run **starter repo** for this project?
2. Help with parsing **Final Draft (.fdx)** or PDF scripts?
3. Integration tips with your existing footage library or folder structure?

Let me know your next priority ‚Äî I‚Äôll guide you step-by-step.

Great ‚Äî adding **emotion detection** to your script parsing can **enrich your footage search** by allowing you to filter scenes by **tone or mood** ‚Äî for example:
üé≠ *‚ÄúFind all scenes where John is angry‚Äù*, or *‚ÄúSearch emotional moments with Sarah‚Äù.*

This is useful for **editorial decisions**, **highlight reels**, or **tagging scenes for AI-based editing tools.**

## üîç What Is Emotion Detection?

Emotion detection (also called **affective analysis**) means using NLP to identify emotions like:

* **Joy / Happiness**
* **Sadness**
* **Anger**
* **Fear**
* **Surprise**
* **Neutral**

## ‚úÖ Options for Detecting Emotion from Script

| Method                                          | Tool                     | Pros               | Cons                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| üîπ Simple Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) | `TextBlob`, `VADER`      | Fast, light        | Not nuanced                   |
| üî∏ Emotion Classification (6+ emotions)         | HuggingFace transformers | Accurate, modern   | Slower, needs GPU or internet |
| üß† Fine-tuned LLM                               | OpenAI GPT, etc.         | Deep understanding | Needs API or custom model     |

---

## üß™ Quick Option 1: VADER for Basic Sentiment (Fast)

```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

sentence = "John slams the door and yells in rage."

score = analyzer.polarity_scores(sentence)

print(score)
# Output: {'neg': 0.582, 'neu': 0.318, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': -0.7351}
```

You can categorize based on compound score:

```python
compound = score['compound']
if compound > 0.5:
    emotion = "Positive"
elif compound < -0.5:
    emotion = "Negative"
else:
    emotion = "Neutral"
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Option 2: Emotion Classification Model

Use a **pre-trained model** from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). Here‚Äôs a good one:

üß† **Model:** `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`
‚û°Ô∏è Detects: joy, anger, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, neutral

### üîß Setup:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### üß™ Code:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

emotion_classifier = pipeline("text-classification", 
                              model="j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base",
                              return_all_scores=True)

text = "John slams the door and yells in rage."

results = emotion_classifier(text)[0]

# Get top emotion
top_emotion = max(results, key=lambda x: x['score'])
print(f"Emotion: {top_emotion['label']} ({top_emotion['score']:.2f})")
```

üí° You can run this **on every sentence** in your script and store the results.

---

## üì¶ Sample Structured Output

For each sentence:

```json
{
  "sentence": "John slams the door and yells in rage.",
  "characters": ["John"],
  "actions": ["slam", "yell"],
  "objects": ["door"],
  "emotion": "anger",
  "emotion_score": 0.88
}
```

---

## üéõÔ∏è Integrate into UI

In Streamlit or your frontend, add a dropdown or filter for emotion:

```python
selected_emotion = st.selectbox("Filter by Emotion", ["All", "anger", "joy", "fear", "sadness", "surprise"])

# Filter results
for line in structured:
    if selected_emotion == "All" or line["emotion"] == selected_emotion:
        st.write(f"{line['sentence']} ({line['emotion']})")
```

---

## üîÑ Full Integration Flow

1. üß† Parse script with spaCy
2. üß™ Analyze each line with emotion model
3. üóÇ Add emotion data to structured format
4. üîç Build tag + emotion filter in UI
5. üìº Link to matching video clips
