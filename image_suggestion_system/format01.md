Got it 👍 You mean **writing a content script** (like what to say/write in an Instagram post, Reel, or Story).

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to write a strong Instagram content script:

---

## 1. **Hook (First 3 seconds / First line)**

* Grab attention immediately.
* Use curiosity, questions, or bold statements.

**Examples:**

* “Nobody tells you this about \[topic]…”
* “Want to \[achieve result] without \[pain point]?”
* “Here’s the secret to \[benefit] in just 30 seconds.”

---

## 2. **Relatable Problem**

* Show your audience you understand their struggle.
* Make them feel “That’s me!”

**Example:**

* “Most people struggle with \[pain point] because…”
* “You’ve probably tried \[common wrong solution], but it didn’t work, right?”

---

## 3. **Value / Solution**

* Share the tip, trick, or insight.
* Keep it simple, clear, and easy to follow.

**Example:**

* “Instead of doing \[wrong way], try \[right way].”
* “Here’s a 3-step formula: \[Step 1], \[Step 2], \[Step 3].”

---

## 4. **Call-to-Action (CTA)**

* Tell your audience what to do next.
* Could be:

  * Engagement CTA → “Save this post”, “Comment YES if you agree”, “Share with a friend”.
  * Business CTA → “DM me ‘Plan’ to get my free guide”, “Check the link in bio”.

✅ **Example Script for a Reel (Fitness niche):**

**Hook:**
“Struggling to lose belly fat? Here’s why your workouts aren’t working…”

**Problem:**
“Most people think endless crunches will give abs, but that’s not true.”

**Value:**
“You need 3 things:

1. Calorie deficit 🥗
2. Strength training 💪
3. Consistency ⏰
   Do this for 8 weeks, and you’ll see results.”

**CTA:**
“Follow me for more no-nonsense fitness tips. And save this video to start today!”

👉 Do you want me to make a **ready-to-use script template** (like fill-in-the-blanks) that you can adapt for any niche, or should I make an example script for *your niche*?
