Writing a script for storytelling on Instagram requires brevity, emotional engagement, and a clear structure—since attention spans are short and you often have limited time (especially for Reels or Stories). Whether it’s for a personal story, brand message, or product, your script should be visually driven and easy to follow.

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** for writing a script for storytelling on Instagram:

---

## 🧩 **1. Define Your Purpose**

Before writing, answer:

* What’s the main message?
* What do I want the viewer to feel or do after watching?
* Is it to **inspire**, **educate**, **promote**, or **entertain**?

---

## 📜 **2. Use a 3-Part Structure**

### **Hook (0-3 seconds)** – Grab Attention

* Ask a question.
* Use a bold statement.
* Show an intriguing visual or moment.
* Examples:

  * “I lost everything in one night...”
  * “Most people won’t tell you this...”

### **Middle (3–20 seconds)** – Build the Story

* Share the key moment or challenge.
* Keep it visual: show emotions, expressions, key scenes.
* Use natural, conversational language.

### **End (20–30 seconds)** – Resolution + Call to Action

* Wrap up the story with insight or result.
* Ask the audience to comment, like, share, follow, or reflect.
* Example:

  * “That one decision changed my life.”
  * “Ever felt the same way? Drop a 💬.”

---

## ✏️ **3. Write the Script in Spoken Style**

Use **short sentences**, **pauses**, and **emotionally charged words**.

### Example Script (Personal Story Style):

**Hook**:
*"You ever have a moment where everything just… stops?"*

**Middle**:
*"Last year, I was laid off. No warning, no backup plan. Rent was due. My confidence? Gone."*
*"But instead of panicking… I picked up my camera."*
*"I started filming moments. Small, ordinary ones. And people… connected with them."*

**End**:
*"One year later, I’m a full-time content creator."*
*"So if you're stuck right now—just start. Even if it’s messy."*
*"Tag someone who needs to hear this."*

---

## 🎥 **4. Match Script to Visuals**

Plan shots to match the tone and moments:

* **B-Roll**: Footage of places, actions, or objects while you speak.
* **Face to Camera**: Create intimacy by speaking directly to the audience.
* Use **captions/subtitles** – many users watch without sound.

---

## 📌 Extra Tips:

* Keep it under **30–60 seconds** for Reels.
* Add text overlays for key points.
* Use trending audio *if relevant* to boost reach.
* Use a clear **call to action** (CTA): "Follow for more", "Save this", etc.

Absolutely — here's a reusable **system prompt** that you can use for breaking down any script (like those in the **agentic** format) into **Hook, Middle, End** with the specific elements you mentioned:

---

### ✅ SYSTEM PROMPT (Copy & Paste Ready):

> You are a content strategist for short-form video platforms like TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts.
>
> When I give you a script (in any format), break it down into 3 sections:
> **Hook**, **Middle**, and **End**.
>
> For each section, extract the following:
>
> * **Emotion** (primary emotional tone)
> * **Action** (what's happening)
> * **Setting** (where it's happening)
> * **Prop** (important objects or items involved)
> * **Identity** (who is speaking or acting — persona, archetype, or role)
>
> Then, generate **3-5 specific, searchable B-roll keywords** that are:
>
> * **Visually literal** (show exactly what’s happening)
> * **Emotionally aligned** (match the vibe)
> * **Optimized for TikTok/Reels search**
>
> Output should be formatted clearly like this:
>
> ---
>
> **HOOK**
>
> * Emotion:
> * Action:
> * Setting:
> * Prop:
> * Identity:
> * B-Roll Keywords:
>   1\.
>   2\.
>   3\.
>   4\.
>   5\.
>
> ---
>
> **MIDDLE**
>
> * Emotion:
> * Action:
> * Setting:
> * Prop:
> * Identity:
> * B-Roll Keywords:
>   1\.
>   2\.
>   3\.
>   4\.
>   5\.
>
> ---
>
> **END**
>
> * Emotion:
> * Action:
> * Setting:
> * Prop:
> * Identity:
> * B-Roll Keywords:
>   1\.
>   2\.
>   3\.
>   4\.
>   5\.
