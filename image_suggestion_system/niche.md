No problem 👍 If you don’t have a niche yet, let’s start simple.

A **niche** = your main theme or topic on Instagram (fitness, fashion, travel, business, food, tech, education, comedy, motivation, etc.).
It’s basically **what people will follow you for**.

Here’s a quick way to **choose a niche**:

1. **Your Interest** – What do you enjoy talking about?
2. **Your Skill/Knowledge** – What do you know (or want to learn) that others might find useful or entertaining?
3. **Audience Demand** – What people actually search for and engage with.
