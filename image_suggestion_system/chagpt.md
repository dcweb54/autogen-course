A great keyword from your script to search for B-roll footage would be:

**"small moments"**

This aligns perfectly with the emotional tone and the core message of your story—finding meaning in everyday life. You can also try variations depending on what vibe you want:

* **"everyday life"**
* **"quiet moments"**
* **"reflective mood"**
* **"camera filming daily life"**
* **"content creator at work"**
* **"starting over"**

Let me know what kind of mood or visual tone you want, and I can help refine it further.


Got it — you're looking for a **context-aware** keyword that fits your specific narrative:
Laid off, picked up a camera, started filming small moments, became a full-time content creator.

Here are a few **contextual, specific keywords** you can use to search for B-roll footage:
